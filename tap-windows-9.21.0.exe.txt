Notes regarding the tap-windows-9.21.0.exe
------------------------------------------

This installer contains an NDIS 6 -compatible tap-windows driver. As such, it 
will not work on Windows XP (which only supports NDIS 5), but should work just 
fine on Windows Vista and above.

The installer will replace existing (NDIS 5) drivers. As this tap-windows6 (NDIS 
6) driver has _not_ been extensively tested yet it's probably best not to 
install it on critical production systems quite yet. If you experience any 
problems with this driver or the installer please file a bug report here:
